# Warmth Obsidian theme

a light theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) app with warm earth tones. 

**no longer maintained**: i love that there are people who like using this theme. i don't have the time or energy to maintain it or even go back and fix things for new updates to obsidian. 

i'm going to remove this theme from the community themes hub as soon as i figure out how. i'll leave it up here on github for whoever wants to play around with it. have fun, make it your own, do what you want with it. if you make something cool out of it and want to share, please let me know.

## updated title bar - 2021.06.01

after numerous requests, i've updated the broken titlebar. it now looks much better. 

there are a number of other visual issues that really, really bug me, so i think i'll spend some time updating this theme very soon.

## installation

this theme is part of the community themes. you can easily install from within the app itself. 

to manually install, download **warmth.css** and place into the **.obsidian/themes/** folder in your vault. you can switch to this theme under **settings > appearance > theme** option. 

a lot of people are using it even though it needs a lot of updating and refining. i pulled some of the colors from the warmth theme into my more current theme [al-dente](https://github.com/chad-bennett/al-dente-obsidian-theme). it has become my main driver. i hope you like it too.

as always, please let me know if there are issues or tweaks you think would improve the theme.

using [Metropolis](https://github.com/chrismsimpson/Metropolis) font, but can easily swap out for you favorite font. 

***a work in progress, so if you have ideas for tweaks or changes, please let me know.***
